# FoodTruck Fiesta

This is one of my early projects from when I was learning basic web development (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap).  
It’s a simple landing page with a food-truck theme: hero section, menu cards, an about area, and a contact form.

I recently cleaned up the UI a bit to make it more consistent, fix spacing, and update the colors, but the original style and structure are the same.

## What I used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- Bootstrap (CDN)

## Why this repo exists
I keep some of my older beginner projects as a way to track how much I’ve improved over time.  
Nothing advanced here, just early practice.
